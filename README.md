# BIPOLAR-DISORDER-PREDICTION
Worked on bipolar disorder spectrum using BPD clinical test dataset and various machine learning models. Intially it was to compare the prediction between the ML models but turned out to be the best thesis of my college year which were later on published.
Research Objectives 
1.	To Evaluate the Predictive Performance of Machine Learning Models: Assessing the effectiveness of machine learning models, specifically the Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor, in predicting bipolar disorder clinical assessments. 
2.	To Compare the Accuracy of Model Predictions: Comparing the accuracy of predictions made by the Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor in diagnosing bipolar disorder clinical outcomes. 
3.	To Contribute to Mental Health Care: Contribute findings that can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing bipolar disorder, thus enhancing patient care and mental health outcomes.
